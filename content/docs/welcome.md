The intent of this site is to simplify procedures that let you personalize your ereader. I've written these docs with a nontechnical reader in mind, someone who may not have as much exposure to file management and certain verbiage you may hear from developers. That said, I hope that readers at all experience levels will learn something.

It's important to me that hacking your device is as accessible as possible. In an era where tech companies want us overly dependent on their costly, subscription-based solutions, learning how to DIY your device into something that oozes your personality is really empowering. Not only that, I believe the more educated we are about how tech devices work, the less susceptible to slop we become. It also lets us say no when tech companies try to force us into throwing our money at them.

I believe that now more than ever we need to educate ourselves (and others!) about our technologies. And even moreso than that, my hope is that learning to tinker with your ereader opens up an entirely new world of really claiming your devices as your own. ♡

## My Kobo set-up

I'll refer to some things I've done with my Koreader set-up throughout these docs. Here's the outcome of my current set up:

![](./images/my-kobo.png )

I've used:

* NickelMenu to launch Koreader
* ProjectTitle plugin
* A plugin that lets me use my Nintendo Switch joycon as a page turner
* A few patches I've experimented with
* Custom fonts
* Custom screensavers for the default Kobo device and Koreader
* Custom icons for every menu item

In the past I've had Wallabag, Rakuyomi, and some other plugins. I don't use those right now, but I have gotten them to work. 

## Who this site is for

This site is intended for nontechnical audiences, though I hope the documentation can assist users at all levels. I've noticed a lot of confusion with certain tasks that I believe I can simplify with some good old fashioned, non-AI generated docs. I'm a technical writer by trade, so this is right up my alley.

I've tried to cite my sources when possible and I'll try my best to maintain the docs so they're up to date. Really, I want ereader hacking to be as accessible as possible, which means sometimes explaining concepts, making suggestions, or writing in a relatively verbose way that a developer might not need. 

If my procedures or concepts aren't clear, please let me know by [filing a GitHub issue](https://github.com/littlepriests/kobo-beginner/issues).  If you don't know what that means, then you will soon. ♡♡♡♡
