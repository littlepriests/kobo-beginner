# ereader-unofficial

This is the repository for [ereader-unofficial](https://ereader-unofficial.netlify.app/docs/welcome/). 

Feel free to file pull requests to update docs for any reason. I'll review and merge as needed. Right now these docs cover Kobo and Koreader. I'm looking for draft content for:

* Jail breaking a Kindle 
* Notes for what these procedures look like on MacOS and Linux
* Suggestions on future content

The site is built with Hugo using Hextra theme. :)
