{"/docs/best-practices-tools/":{"data":{"":"There are certain tools that can make your life easier while you personalize. I’ll describe each and why you might want to take some time signing up for new tools.","back-up-folder#Back-up folder":"I recommend creating a folder to house all the resources (images, files, plugins, installers etc) in an area on your PC. I keep mine in a folder named Kobo Resources. It has screensaver images, icons, books, and a copy of my entire KOBOeReader(D:) directory.\nWhen you start tinkering with devices, it’s good practice to have a back up somewhere so should you nuke your software, you can drag and drop your back up from a save point.","github#GitHub":"Creators of plugins and patches will typically host them in GitHub repositories. You can think of a repository (or repo) as a landing page for packages of code that make your device do something it doesn’t do out of the box.\nI strongly recommend creating a GitHub account so you can star repos for plugins you’re using. Here are some other benefits of just having a GitHub account:\nYou can file issues with creators of certain plugins, which alerts them of potential buggy or unexpected behavior. Other users can help since issues are public. If you want to create your own plugins and patches, you can house them in your own GitHub repo, where users can star and circulate them to other readers. Everything cool happens on GitHub, honestly. I have repos saved for pirating, adding apps to my phone, and using other open source software. It’s neat.","lets-review-really-quick#Let\u0026rsquo;s review really quick":"Here’s my suggested PEMDAS before we start downloading files and messing with our device:\nCreate a back up folder on your PC for your Kobo device. Sign up for a GitHub account so you can bookmark repos. Familiarize yourself with a text editor, and maybe consider installing VS Code. Once you’ve done one or all of these things, you’re in a good place to install Koreader and customize your Kobo","vs-code-textedit-and-notepad#VS Code, TextEdit, and Notepad":"If procedures for a particular plugin say to open a file in a text editor, they usually mean something that lets you edit files in plain text. The typical recommendation is your operating system’s text editor (like TextEdit and Notepad), but I recommend installing VS Code.\nVS Code is an interface that lets you manage files and folders without juggling multiple File Explorer windows. You can search, open, and edit files directly in VS Code without opening other windows. It’s customizable and out of the box it gives you a clean interface for handling code. One use case where VS Code really helped me was updating icons in Koreader. I had to find the original file names in a deeply nested folder inside .kobo, then create a new folder that overwrites those icons for Koreader. The file names had to be the same. I use VS Code in split window view so I could more easily edit icon names without losing my windows in a file explorer.\nAnother use case is tracking your changes. VS Code differentiates new files, folders, and images from existing resources. If you add a folder but forgot where you put it, VS Code will have it highlighted until you save."},"title":"Best practices and tools"},"/docs/customize-koreader/":{"data":{"":"Okay.

I wanted to transcribe these procedures to preserve them, and give users more options for setting up Koreader. The doc won’t cover how to jailbreak your Kindle, nor should you assume that it’ll help you use Koreader on non-Kobo devices.","phase-1-edit-kobo-conf-file#Phase 1: Edit Kobo \u003ccode\u003e.conf\u003c/code\u003e file":"Plug in your ereader.\nGo to .kobo \u003e Kobo \u003e Kobo ereader.conf.\nOpen the .conf file in some kind of text editor (like VS Code, TextEdit, or Notepad) and add this snippet to the top of the file (Kobo will put it in the correct place when it updates):\n[FeatureSettings]\rExcludeSyncFolders=(\\\\.(?!kobo|adobe).+|([^.][^/]*/)+\\\\..+) Save, then safely eject your ereader.\nI’m not sure what this step does but I’ve reached out to Techy-Notes to confirm why we do this. What I can confirm right now is that my Kobo has worked just fine with this edit.","phase-2-install-nickelmenu#Phase 2: Install NickelMenu":"Plug in your ereader.\nGo to the release page of the NickelMenu repository and download the latest release of KoboRoot.tgz.\nThe file you need is in the Assets section. I strongly recommend that you keep a copy of the most recent release handy. NickelMenu sometimes disappears as we tinker with our ereader, and the best way to get it back is to follow the NickelMenu install step. Find where KoboRoot.tgz downloaded on your PC, then copy KoboRoot.tgz and paste it into the .kobo directory.\nEject your ereader and let it update.\nLet Kobo boot up, and confirm that NickelMenu appears as a new menu item. Should be on the far right after More.\nReconnect your Kobo again (lol), then look at the root directory. Notice the new folder that has appeared in your directory called .adds: that’s good.\nOpen .adds to see a new folder named nm. Inside the nm directory, create a new file called menu (without a file extension) and paste in the following code snippet:\nexperimental :menu_main_15505_icon :/mnt/onboard/.adds/nm/.icon.png\rexperimental: menu_main_15505_label : +NM+\rmenu_item : main : Koreader+ : cmd_spawn :quiet :exec /mnt/onboard/.adds/Koreader/Koreader.sh\rmenu_item : main : Dark Mode : nickel_setting : toggle : dark_mode\rmenu_item : main : Screenshots : nickel_setting : toggle : screenshots\rmenu_item : main : Import books : nickel_misc : rescan_books_full\rmenu_item : main : Reboot : power : reboot\rmenu_item : main : Shutdown : power : shutdown\rmenu_item : main : WiFi On/Off : nickel_setting : toggle : force_wifi\rchain_success : nickel_wifi : toggle\rmenu_item : main : USB Connect : nickel_misc : force_usb_connection\r# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #\rmenu_item : reader : Dark Mode : nickel_setting : toggle : dark_mode\rmenu_item : reader : Screenshots : nickel_setting : toggle : screenshots\rmenu_item : reader : Goodreads : nickel_browser : https://www.goodreads.com/book\rmenu_item : reader : USB Connect : nickel_misc : force_usb_connection\r# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #\rmenu_item : library : Dark Mode : nickel_setting : toggle : dark_mode\rmenu_item : library : Screenshots : nickel_setting : toggle : screenshots\rmenu_item : library : Import books : nickel_misc : rescan_books_full\rmenu_item : library : Reboot : power : reboot\rmenu_item : library : Shutdown : power : shutdown\rmenu_item : library : WiFi On/Off : nickel_setting : toggle : force_wifi\rchain_success : nickel_wifi : toggle\rmenu_item : library : USB Connect : nickel_misc : force_usb_connection Eject safely, let your ereader update, and confirm that menu options appear by clicking the NickelMenu item on your default Kobo page.","phase-3-install-koreader#Phase 3: Install Koreader":"Plug in your ereader (lol).\nGo to the release page of the Koreader repository and download the file that corresponds with your ereader device. The files you need are located in the Assets subsection.\nIt’s a .zip file, so we need to extract its contents. Right click the .zip folder you just downloaded, and extract. A duplicate folder without the .zip file extension should appear in your working directory.\nInside that newly extracted folder, find the Koreader subdirectory, then right click copy that folder.\nPaste the folder into .adds. The directory should now look like this:\nEject your ereader and let it update, then view the fruits of your labor!","set-up-koreader-as-your-default-launcher#Set up Koreader as your default launcher":"There is a lot of ejecting, checking, then plugging in your ereader in all of these procedures. This is intentional. It helps you keep clear idea of when things stopped working.\nIf you did all these steps without ejecting your ereader once, got to the end, and things were broken, you wouldn’t really know the phase that things went south. It’s much more helpful to say “I added the file during step X and it worked. But when I completed step Y, I got this error.”\nAnyway, be kind to yourself and safely eject, check, and replug it in."},"title":"Install Koreader"},"/docs/very-beginner/":{"data":{"":"This doc is for readers who don’t have too much exposure hacking their devices, but want to personalize their ereader.\nIf you’re someone who already had a Github account before your ereader, then go ahead and start here.

This task should give you a firmer grasp on the kinds of actions we’ll take everywhere else in these docs, like adding resources to folders and creating new folders inside your Kobo. It should prime you to install Koreader, too, which is famously a pain in the ass.","lets-review-really-quick#Let\u0026rsquo;s review really quick":"Earlier I said that tinkering with devices is just playing with files and folders. Everything you do here on out will follow this broad procedure:\nPlug in your Kobo. Either create a new folder and add some files to it, or add a folder to an existing folder, or even just edit some text in an existing file… or add a new file. You get the picture, lol. Eject your Kobo safely. Wait for an update, then see the results. There is a diabolical fifth step that involves troubleshooting and repeating all of these steps until you get the results you want. You will get a crash page sometimes… But the good news is Kobo is super forgiving with the DIY hacker spirit, so worry not. :)","step-1-plug-in-your-kobo-via-usb-to-your-pc#Step 1: Plug in your Kobo via USB to your PC":"First thing’s first: at the end of the day every piece of technology is just a bunch of folders and files that you can view and edit from your File Explorer. Your Kobo is no different. So let’s plug her in:\nThe screenshot shows a plugged in Kobo (KOBOeReader(D:)) and all the folders that make up my Kobo’s root directory. The difference between a root directory and regular directory is that root indicates the top-most level in a file structure. Sometimes people will call something root when it’s not, so clarify what they mean if you’re uncertain.\nMy device already has a bunch of directories (or folders, but we’ll use the term directories throughout these docs). You you may or may not recognize some of these. .adds is where NickelMenu and Koreader will eventually live; Books is where I keep all my epubs, which live in subdirectories by genre; .fonts is where I’ve added my own fonts; and so on.\nBut let’s ignore all that for now and move on to the second step.","step-2-create-a-folder-in-kobo#Step 2: Create a folder in \u003ccode\u003e.kobo\u003c/code\u003e":"Select .kobo to open the main Kobo directory. A bunch of stuff appears. Take a look, then ignore all of it for now:\nCreate a new folder called screensaver. This is where you’ll add new images so when your Kobo is asleep or powered off, you’ll have something custom on display. Your directory should look like this:\nRe: .kobo: This is one of two directories you might use often.\nGenerally speaking, making changes to the .kobo directory introduces new behaviors and outcomes for your default Kobo software. For example, images in the .kobo screensaver folder will appear when your device goes asleep from the default launcher. You may need to add something to .kobo even if you’re modifying something in Koreader. Be cognizant of what folder you’re adding shit to in future procedures, and clarify if you’re uncertain.","step-3-add-an-image#Step 3. Add an image":"Find an image and add it to screensavers. Copy any old downloaded image from your PC and paste it into the new folder. Should look something like this:\nI use a Kobo Libra Color, and the resolution size that gets the full screen effect is 926x1200. Don’t know what aspect ratio that is, so can’t help anyone there. As far as I can tell image titles and file extensions (that is the .png and .jpg) aren’t super important, though IIRC my Kobo didn’t load any .webp images.","step-4-safely-eject#Step 4. Safely eject":"Any time you want to test if some modification worked, you need to safely eject. To safely eject, right click on KOBOeReader (D:) and choose Eject. Don’t just unplug your device.\nYour Kobo will update, then turn on. Put your Kobo in sleep mode and the image you added should appear. :)","whats-next#What\u0026rsquo;s next?":"You have two options for the next part of your journey.

I’ve written these docs with a nontechnical reader in mind, someone who may not have as much exposure to file management and certain verbiage you may hear from developers. That said, I hope that readers at all experience levels will learn something.\nIt’s important to me that hacking your device is as accessible as possible. In an era where tech companies want us overly dependent on their costly, subscription-based solutions, learning how to DIY your device into something that oozes your personality is really empowering. Not only that, I believe the more educated we are about how tech devices work, the less susceptible to slop we become. It also lets us say no when tech companies try to force us into throwing our money at them.\nI believe that now more than ever we need to educate ourselves (and others!) about our technologies. And even moreso than that, my hope is that learning to tinker with your ereader opens up an entirely new world of really claiming your devices as your own. ♡","my-kobo-set-up#My Kobo set-up":"I’ll refer to some things I’ve done with my Koreader set-up throughout these docs.

I’m a technical writer by trade, so this is right up my alley.\nI’ve tried to cite my sources when possible and I’ll try my best to maintain the docs so they’re up to date. Really, I want ereader hacking to be as accessible as possible, which means sometimes explaining concepts, making suggestions, or writing in a relatively verbose way that a developer might not need.\nIf my procedures or concepts aren’t clear, please let me know by filing a GitHub issue.
